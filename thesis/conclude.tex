\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we dramatically improve de Melo and Banal's work at ranking adjective in terms of their intensity on a continuous scale. We confront sparsity of data in three ways: leveraging webscale corpus, incorporating additional linguistic patterns, and most importantly filling in missing data by approximating the distribution of phrases by assuming the phrases are generated in a Markov manner. Since the approximation is not gauranteed to be consistent, we enforce transitivity using a simple integer linear program. 

Not only is our integer linear program formulation simpler than that of Bansal's, we also outperform the state of the art across all measures in a nontrivial manner, and approach human level agreement. We do so without relying on additional annotations during ranking, which is a very restrictive assumption. Finally, the sample complexity of our approach is comparable to that of Bansal's.
